$MOVE Token Claim Guidelines
December 4, 2024
Movement Network Foundation
Intro
The $MOVE Token Generation Event (TGE) is coming soon, and we’re excited to unveil new token registration and claim details as we embark on Movement's next chapter!
If using an OKX exchange account, you can register for MoveDrop from Dec 4 at 6AM UTC  -  Dec 6 at 6AM UTC on
the OKX claims registration website
. MoveDrop participants who elect this method will automatically receive their $MOVE in their OKX account.
Eligible wallets can claim $MOVE upon Token Generation Event (TGE).
After TGE, you can check your claimable $MOVE on
the claims website
.
Initial $MOVE claims (including OKX claims) will occur on Ethereum Mainnet.
Choosing to register to claim $MOVE in your OKX account is choosing to claim $MOVE on Ethereum Mainnet and missing eligibility for future multipliers.
Overview
1. OKX Account Registration Phase
If you’re an OKX user, you can now register to receive your $MOVE on OKX. After registration, you do not have to actively claim your $MOVE. Rather, you will automatically receive your $MOVE in your OKX exchange account. To register to receive $MOVE in your OKX account, please provide your
exchange UID
and
MOVE Deposit Address
(ERC20) on the $MOVE claim page. (See tutorial below.)
Registration Period:
Dec 4 at 6AM UTC  -  Dec 6 at 6AM UTC
Deposit Time:
