Movement Network Foundation
Today, the Movement Network Foundation is proud to announce that Movement Network Mainnet Beta has launched. This means that the first phase in the Movement Network launch plan is now live.
Now, infrastructure providers can begin to support Movement.
Movement Network Mainnet Beta
At 16:00 UTC on November 30, 2024, the Movement Network successfully launched with Mainnet Beta. In the current release of Mainnet Beta, infrastructure providers will be able to run
follower nodes
, which are the equivalent of full nodes on other chains. Network operators will run a series of exercises to ensure states sync across the network and operational security.
Today, Mainnet Beta can support:
Follower nodes
RPC nodes
Indexers
Permissioned Smart Contracts
Block explorer
Genesis NFTs
The Movement Network features a unique design. To further explore the Network's
high-level
and
node-level
architectures, please

As $MOVE goes live, users will be able to deposit $MOVE on Ethereum via LST partners to contribute to the security of the Movement Network. By building up $MOVE security, the network will be able to initiate postconfirmations for fast finality execution.
If you are interested in participating as a node operator or, in the future, as a validator, reach out
