Cornucopia: A Year-Long Program to Boost Liquidity
February 3, 2025
Movement Network Foundation
The Movement ecosystem recently announced Cornucopia: a year-long program to jumpstart Movement DeFi liquidity. Cornucopia is about abundance, about juicy harvest, about great potential bounty for all who participate. It will feature several phases.
Phase 1 began last week.
Today, most Cornucopia vaults have opened:
Concrete Vaults
Veda Vaults
Intro to Cornucopia
Cornucopia has numerous vaults grouped under 4 categories: BTC, ETH, stablecoin, and MOVE vaults.
Concrete
and
Veda
manage the vaults. Users can deposit compatible assets to these vaults. After an 8-week lockup period, assets unlock and flow back to users through Movement apps on Movement Public Mainnet Beta (coming soon).
You can deposit select BTC, ETH, and stablecoin assets into Cornucopia vaults today.
The MOVE vault will open soon.
Cornucopia Program Objectives
Cornucopia Phase 1 aims to open the floodgates. It aims to use these vaults to create deep day-one liquidity for our amazing builders and community. Cornucopia shoots to give Movement DeFi rocket fuel from day one. 

At Movement Network Foundation, we want everyone to experience the speed, security, and ease of Movement DeFI as soon as possible.
