Movement Network Foundation Announces MoveDrop
November 26, 2024
Movement Network Foundation
As the Movement Network approaches its Network Genesis and Token Generation Event (“TGE”), we’re excited to reveal our MoveDrop program – designed to reward Movement's early users and community members. For more info on $MOVE, visit our
$MOVE reveal post
.
MoveDrop
, along with other initial claims, allocates up to 1,000,000,000 (10% of maximum supply) to Movement Network's early users and community, distributed across several programs:
Road to Parthenon
Battle of Olympus
Gmovers
Selected Communities
Movement Testnet Builders
The snapshot for MoveDrop was taken on November 23, 2024.
The
MoveDrop registration and claims website
is now live. Participants can visit the website and register from now until December 2, 2024 at 2PM UTC. Upon $MOVE TGE (in the near future), participants can see their MoveDrop eligibility and claim their airdrop.
Eligible participants can choose to claim their airdrop in one of two ways. Initially, MoveDrop claims will be available on Ethereum Mainnet. However, users can also wait until the launch of the public Movement Network and claim their MoveDrop directly on the Movement Network for 1.25x what was available on Ethereum.
Movement Network Foundation also plans to distribute additional $MOVE tokens in future campaigns.
Important Note:
Initial registration has closed. Extended registration is now available.
Airdrop Categories
Road to Parthenon
Road to Parthenon
is a user-focused campaign that launched in July 2024 alongside the Movement Testnet. Road to Parthenon will form the largest category within MoveDrop.
Participants are eligible for MoveDrop allocations in two main categories:
Transaction Completion
: Participants that have completed at least two transactions on two apps on the Porto or Suzuka Movement Testnet will be eligible for MoveDrop, with MoveDrop rewards capping at 300 transactions.
Quest Completion
: Participants that have completed Quests on Road to Parthenon will be eligible for MoveDrop. Rewards will be based on the number of quests completed within each guild. To view completed quests, visit the
Parthenon Quests site
.
For anti-sybil protection, wallets that conducted testnet transactions but did not claim from an applicable faucet will not be eligible for MoveDrop.
Battle of Olympus
The flagship
Battle of Olympus
hackathon (May to September 2024) showcased  developer community's talent while helping build the foundation of the Movement ecosystem. MoveDrop allocations will be distributed to
10 winners and 53 runners-up
.
Gmove
Movement has primarily engaged its user and developer community through X. The phrase “gmove” has become a movement associated with Movement Network. MoveDrop will award users, selected at random, who have posted “gmove” as part of their tweets – including a larger allocation to participants of the #gmovechallenge, where submissions were screened individually.
Selected Communities
MoveDrop allocates for key community participants, including:
Movement Discord
: Holders of select roles on Movement Labs’ Discord, where roles are awarded on a strict basis according to completion of tasks. Roles associated with more difficult tasks receive a larger allocation within MoveDrop.
Centurions
: Centurions, members of a Movement ambassador program.
Gorilla Moverz
: A Movement community that discusses all matters related to Movement Network. They have been known to shake ass and consume potassium.
Other Groups
: Selected smaller communities who have contributed to the Movement.
Movement Testnet Builders
Selected teams building on Movement Network will be eligible for a MoveDrop allocation – with teams being strictly screened, and with allocations based on their contribution to Movement Network and preparedness for Movement Network Mainnet.
