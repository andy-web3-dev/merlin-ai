$MOVE TGE Is Here
December 9, 2024
Movement Network Foundation
Today, Movement Network Foundation is proud to announce the Token Generation Event (“TGE”) of $MOVE. This represents a significant milestone for the Movement Network, creating Network utility and opening new pathways for the long-term growth of the Network in a manner governed by the community.
Token Generation Event of $MOVE
On December 9 at approximately 12:00 UTC, Movement Network Foundation successfully launched $MOVE – the utility token of the Movement Network ecosystem.
Movement Network Foundation hopes that $MOVE will help it achieve its long-term objectives. The launch of $MOVE creates the foundational utility that the Movement Network will rely on.
$MOVE is available on major centralized and decentralized venues – please refer to the latest updates on these venues via

There is another option. MoveDrop participants can wait and claim on Movement Network Public Mainnet. This may create eligibility for a 1.25x $MOVE multiplier.
Movement Network Mainnet Beta
Last week, Movement Network foundation successfully launched Mainnet Beta. This initial phase of the Movement Network’s launch allows for infrastructure providers to initiate operations, including providers running follower nodes and RPC nodes. It also enables the Movement Network to begin building economic security on Ethereum Mainnet, a necessity for testing and improving the Movement’s postconfirmations.
Concluding Thoughts
With the $MOVE TGE, we’re thrilled for what’s next for the Movement Network. We’re also excited to see how the amazing Movement community will guide the Movement Network and bring Move’s superior security guarantees to Ethereum.
