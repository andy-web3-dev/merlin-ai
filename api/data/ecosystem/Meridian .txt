Weighted Pools
What are Weighted Pools?
Meridian's Weighted Pools operate by enforcing a Constant Weighted Product invariant for token swaps. A subset of these, known as liquidity bootstrapping pools, caters to auction-like mechanisms. These pools employ Weighted Math, making them versatile for a wide array of applications, including asset pairings without price correlation (e.g., ETH-USDC).

Default Swap Fee

Oracle Usage

Unlike conventional x*y=k pools which are limited to 2 tokens of equivalent weights (50/50) , Meridian's weighted pools offer flexibility in token counts and proportions. Users can create pools with different weightings such as 80/20 or 60/20/20, among others. Available pairs are dictated by the standard combination formula below:
Meridian supports weighted pools with up to 4 total assets. As each asset within a pool can be traded against any other, the number of available swaps grows exponentially - reaching up to * pairs for pools with the maximum number of _ tokens. This proliferation of swap pairs naturally encourages increased trading activity, thereby boosting fee collection and distribution to liquidity providers.
Impermanent Loss
Weighted pools offer flexibility in how assets are weighted against each other, allowing liquidity providers to adjust the proportion of each token in the pool. As the token weight increases in favor of one asset, it significantly reduces the unrealized impermanent loss. For example, Impermanent loss decreases in a two-token pool as the asset weight changes, relative to price fluctuations between the tokens.
However, while weighted pools help minimize impermanent loss, they also introduce trade-offs in terms of price slippage. In pools where one token is heavily weighted, swaps experience higher slippage due to the reduced liquidity of the less weighted asset. To balance the reduction in impermanent loss with adequate liquidity, an 80/20 weighting ratio is commonly recommended.

Stable Pools
Stable Pools are tailored for tokens pegged to specific values, synthetics like liquid-staking derivatives, or assets correlated with others. This category encompasses stablecoins, synthetic or wrapped assets, and staked derivatives (e.g., staked Aptos and Aptos). These pools facilitate low-impact, low-fee exchanges between assets converging on a relative value of "1".

Amplification Factor
 
Stable pools can be fine-tuned using an "amplification factor" (A), which influences trade price impact. This factor determines how closely the pool's trading curve aligns with either the constant product or constant sum curve. A low amplification factor makes the pool's assets more susceptible to deviating from their peg, while a high factor requires significant trade volumes to shift relative asset values. It's worth noting that maximizing this factor isn't always optimal, as it can affect fee accumulation in the presence of alternative markets for similar assets.
Low Amplification Factor
: In a pool with a low amplification factor, even small trades can cause noticeable deviations from the peg, making the pool less stable. Low A-factor is more suited for asset pairs that are less tightly correlated.
High Amplification Factor
: A high amplification factor makes the pool more resistant to price deviations. For example, swapping between dollar-pegged stablecoins in a pool with a high amplification factor would result in minimal price impact, even for larger trade sizes. 
Pool Parameters
 
The pool creator initially sets the amplification factor, which can only be modified subsequently through protocol governance. Any intended changes to this factor over time require the submission of a governance proposal.

Swap Fees
In line with standard capital market practices, liquidity providers on the Meridian platform earn fees when users trade against their supplied liquidity. Fees are collected in the swapped token. For instance, in a pool of Meridian's governance token (MDN) and Move Dollar (MOD), a user swapping MOD for MDN results in liquidity providers receiving a portion of the input token, MOD. Meridian LP tokens automatically accrue these fees, representing fractional ownership of the pool.
The fee structure is set by the pool creator and customizable across different asset pool types. The default swap fees are as following:
Weighted Pools: 0.15%
Concentrated Liquidity Pools: 0.03% 
Stable Pools: 0.05% 
Protocol fees are set at 50%, with the other 50% directly accruing to liquidity providers. For example, a 1.00% fee pool would effectively allocate 0.50% of swap volume to liquidity providers and the protocol treasury, respectively

What is a Flash Loan?
Flash Loans allow you to borrow any available amount of assets without putting up any collateral, as long as the liquidity is returned to the protocol within the same transaction. To do a Flash Loan, you must build a contract requesting a Flash Loan. The contract will then need to execute the instructed steps and pay back the loan + fees all within the same transaction.
How do we support Flash Loans?
With Move, we implement flash loans using the 
hot-potato pattern
. Let's go through the code to better understand it.
First, we define a 
Flashloan
 struct without any 
abilities
.
Copy
struct Flashloan<phantom Asset0, phantom Asset1, phantom Asset2, phantom Asset3> {


  amount_0: u64,


  amount_1: u64,


  amount_2: u64,


  amount_3: u64,


}
The struct records the number of 
Coin<T>
's that were borrowed. Because this struct does not have the 
key
 or 
store
 ability, it cannot be transferred or otherwise placed in persistent storage. Because it does not have the 
drop
 ability, it cannot be discarded. Thus, the only way to get rid of this struct is to call 
repay
 sometime during the transaction that created it, which is exactly what we want from a flash loan. Otherwise, your code won't even compile.
Flash Loan fee
Meridian charges a fixed 1bps flash loan fee.
Utilizing Flash Loans
Call 
flashloan
 and 
pay_flashloan
 in the same transaction. Here's a complete example:
Copy
script {


    use bridge::asset::USDC;


    use bridge::asset::USDT;




    use aptos_std::math64;


    use aptos_framework::coin;




    use thalaswap::base_pool::Null;


    use thalaswap::stable_pool;


    use thalaswap::weighted_pool::{Self, Weight_50};




    const FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT: u64 = 10000;


    const FLASHLOAN_FEE_BPS: u64 = 1;


    const BPS_BASE: u64 = 10000;




    fun main(account: &signer) {


        // stable pool example


        // 1. acquire flashloan


        let (coin_0, coin_1, coin_2, coin_3, flashloan) = stable_pool::flashloan<USDC, USDT, Null, Null>(FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT, 0, 0, 0);




        // 2. do something with the coins




        // 3. calculate fee amount


        let fee_amount = math64::mul_div(FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT, FLASHLOAN_FEE_BPS, BPS_BASE);


        // alternatively, you can use `flashloan_fee_bps` view function to get the fee bps


        // let fee_amount = math64::mul_div(FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT, stable_pool::flashloan_fee_bps<USDC, USDT, Null, Null>(), BPS_BASE);




        // 4. repay flashloan


        let fee = coin::withdraw<USDC>(account, fee_amount);


        coin::merge(&mut coin_0, fee);


        stable_pool::pay_flashloan<USDC, USDT, Null, Null>(coin_0, coin_1, coin_2, coin_3, flashloan);


        


        // weighted pool example


        // 1. acquire flashloan


        let (coin_0, coin_1, coin_2, coin_3, flashloan) = weighted_pool::flashloan<USDC, USDT, Null, Null, Weight_50, Weight_50, Null, Null>(FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT, 0, 0, 0);




        // 2. do something with the coins




        // 3. calculate fee amount


        let fee_amount = math64::mul_div(FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT, FLASHLOAN_FEE_BPS, BPS_BASE);


        // alternatively, you can use `flashloan_fee_bps` view function to get the fee bps


        // let fee_amount = math64::mul_div(FLASHLOAN_AMOUNT, weighted_pool::flashloan_fee_bps<USDC, USDT, Null, Null, Weight_50, Weight_50, Null, Null>(), BPS_BASE);




        // 4. repay flashloan


        let fee = coin::withdraw<USDC>(account, fee_amount);


        coin::merge(&mut coin_0, fee);


        weighted_pool::pay_flashloan<USDC, USDT, Null, Null, Weight_50, Weight_50, Null, Null>(coin_0, coin_1, coin_2, coin_3, flashloan);

The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
15. Limitations as Allowed by Law
Some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

17. Non-Waiver
Our failure or delay in insisting upon or enforcing strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or rights.

18. Severability
In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms and conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

This Agreement is entered into in the British Virgin Islands and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the British Virgin Islands.

Weighted Pools
What are Weighted Pools?
Meridian's Weighted Pools operate by enforcing a Constant Weighted Product invariant for token swaps. A subset of these, known as liquidity bootstrapping pools, caters to auction-like mechanisms. These pools employ Weighted Math, making them versatile for a wide array of applications, including asset pairings without price correlation (e.g., ETH-USDC). 
Property
Weighted
Max Tokens in Pool

Default Swap Fee
0.15%
Oracle Usage

Unlike conventional x*y=k pools which are limited to 2 tokens of equivalent weights (50/50) , Meridian's weighted pools offer flexibility in token counts and proportions. Users can create pools with different weightings such as 80/20 or 60/20/20, among others. Available pairs are dictated by the standard combination formula below:
$nC2 = \frac {n!}{2!(n-2)!}$
Meridian supports weighted pools with up to 4 total assets. As each asset within a pool can be traded against any other, the number of available swaps grows exponentially - reaching up to * pairs for pools with the maximum number of _ tokens. This proliferation of swap pairs naturally encourages increased trading activity, thereby boosting fee collection and distribution to liquidity providers.
Impermanent Loss
Weighted pools offer flexibility in how assets are weighted against each other, allowing liquidity providers to adjust the proportion of each token in the pool. As the token weight increases in favor of one asset, it significantly reduces the unrealized impermanent loss. For example, Impermanent loss decreases in a two-token pool as the asset weight changes, relative to price fluctuations between the tokens.
However, while weighted pools help minimize impermanent loss, they also introduce trade-offs in terms of price slippage. In pools where one token is heavily weighted, swaps experience higher slippage due to the reduced liquidity of the less weighted asset. To balance the reduction in impermanent loss with adequate liquidity, an 80/20 weighting ratio is commonly recommended.

Stable Pools
Stable Pools are tailored for tokens pegged to specific values, synthetics like liquid-staking derivatives, or assets correlated with others. This category encompasses stablecoins, synthetic or wrapped assets, and staked derivatives (e.g., staked Aptos and Aptos). These pools facilitate low-impact, low-fee exchanges between assets converging on a relative value of "1".

Stable Pool Math
 
To accommodate swaps between similar assets, Stable Pools utilize a distinct equation. Meridian employs a Stable Pool invariant (originally developed by Curve), which is as following:

Amplification Factor
 
Stable pools can be fine-tuned using an "amplification factor" (A), which influences trade price impact. This factor determines how closely the pool's trading curve aligns with either the constant product or constant sum curve. A low amplification factor makes the pool's assets more susceptible to deviating from their peg, while a high factor requires significant trade volumes to shift relative asset values. It's worth noting that maximizing this factor isn't always optimal, as it can affect fee accumulation in the presence of alternative markets for similar assets.
Low Amplification Factor
: In a pool with a low amplification factor, even small trades can cause noticeable deviations from the peg, making the pool less stable. Low A-factor is more suited for asset pairs that are less tightly correlated.
High Amplification Factor
: A high amplification factor makes the pool more resistant to price deviations. For example, swapping between dollar-pegged stablecoins in a pool with a high amplification factor would result in minimal price impact, even for larger trade sizes. 
Pool Parameters
 
The pool creator initially sets the amplification factor, which can only be modified subsequently through protocol governance. Any intended changes to this factor over time require the submission of a governance proposal.
