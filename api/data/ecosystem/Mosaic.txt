Setup Authentication
Get quote
To retrieve the best swap rate, send the following HTTP request to get a quote:
Copy
curl 'https://api.mosaic.ag/v1/quote?srcAsset=0x1%3A%3Aaptos_coin%3A%3AAptosCoin&dstAsset=0x275f508689de8756169d1ee02d889c777de1cebda3a7bbcce63ba8a27c563c6f%3A%3Atokens%3A%3AUSDC&amount=1000000000&sender=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&slippage=10' \


--header 'x-api-key: xxx'
This will return the best available quote for swapping the source asset (AptosCoin) into the destination asset (USDC) based on current market conditions.
Here is a detailed guide using Typescript:
1. Setup Environment
Import the required libraries and initialize your connection to the Aptos testnet using the 
AptosConfig
 and 
Aptos
 objects from the 
@aptos-labs/ts-sdk
. This sets up your environment for making requests to the Mosaic Aggregator API and interacting with Aptos.
Copy
import {


  Account,


  Aptos,


  APTOS_COIN,


  AptosConfig,


  Ed25519PrivateKey,


} from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";


import axios from "axios";




// Initialize Aptos config to connect to the testnet


const aptos = new Aptos(


  new AptosConfig({


    fullnode: "https://aptos.testnet.suzuka.movementlabs.xyz/v1",


  })


);
2. Setup User Account
Here, you will create an Aptos account using the user's private key. You need to fill in your own private key when initializing the account.
Copy
// Create user account from private key


const user = Account.fromPrivateKey({


  privateKey: new Ed25519PrivateKey(), // TODO: Fill your private key here.


});
3. Define Assets and Amount
Specify the assets to swap and the amount (in APTOS decimals):
Copy
const srcAsset = APTOS_COIN; // Source: APTOS Coin


const dstAsset =


  "0x275f508689de8756169d1ee02d889c777de1cebda3a7bbcce63ba8a27c563c6f::tokens::USDC"; // Destination: USDC


const amount = 1_00000000; // Amount: 1 APT (APTOS uses 8 decimals)
4. Get a Quote from Mosaic Aggregator API
Retrieve the best swap rate by making a GET request to the Mosaic API.
Copy
// Get a quote from Mosaic Aggregator API


const mosaicResponse = await axios({


  method: "GET",


  url: "https://api.mosaic.ag/v1/quote",


  params: {


    srcAsset,


    dstAsset,


    amount,


    sender: user.accountAddress.toString(),


    slippage: 100, // 100 = 1%


  },


  headers: {


    "X-API-KEY": "xxx", // TODO: Fill the API key in here.


  },


});
5. Build the transaction
Once you have the quote, you use the returned data (function, type arguments, and function arguments) to build a transaction that will perform the swap.
Copy
// Build the transaction based on the Mosaic response


const transaction = await aptos.transaction.build.simple({


  sender: user.accountAddress,


  data: {


    function: mosaicResponse.data.data.tx.function,


    typeArguments: mosaicResponse.data.data.tx.typeArguments,


    functionArguments: mosaicResponse.data.data.tx.functionArguments,


  },


});
6. Sign and submit the transaction
After building the transaction, you sign it using the user's private key and submit the transaction to the Aptos blockchain. The transaction hash will be logged, which can be used to check the transaction status on the explorer.
Copy
// Sign and submit the transaction


const pendingTransactionResponse =


  await aptos.transaction.signAndSubmitTransaction({


    signer: user,


    transaction: transaction,


  });




// Output transaction URL to the console


console.log(


  `Tx = https://explorer.movementnetwork.xyz/txn/${pendingTransactionResponse.hash}?network=testnet`


);
By following this guide, you will be able to integrate the Mosaic Aggregator API for performing token swaps on the Aptos network. For further assistance or inquiries, feel free to reach out to the Mosaic support team on

Mosaic can be used within other sites as an iframe. An iframe shows an exact version of the Mosaic frontend site and can have custom prefilled settings.
One benefit of an iframe integration is that the your site will automatically keep up with any improvements/additions to the site. After the initital integration is setup no further work is needed to pull in updates as the exchange site is updated over time.

Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy 
Welcome to Mosaic, the premier Dex Aggregator on the Movement blockchain. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your personal information on our platform accessible at mosaic.ag. 
Who We Are 
Mosaic is operated by Mosaic Labs. We are responsible for the processing of your personal data as outlined in this policy. Should you have any questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at huy@mosaic.ag
Privacy at Mosaic 
Our platform is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect the least amount of personal data necessary for improving our services and providing a seamless user experience.
Personal Data We Collect:
Basic Interaction Data: 
Includes IP addresses, device information, browser type, and logs that help us diagnose problems and optimize your experience. 
Blockchain Data:
 We access public blockchain data such as wallet addresses and transactions to understand and improve user interactions with our platform. This data is processed collectively and is never used to identify individuals. 
Analytics Information: 
We use tools like Google Analytics to gather data about how you use the platform, which helps us make informed enhancements.
How We Use Your Data
To Improve Services: We analyze user interaction to enhance the usability and features of Mosaic.
For Security: We monitor data to prevent fraud and address security issues. 
Compliance and Enforcement: We use data to comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements. Privacy and policy 1
Cookies and Tracking 
We use cookies to improve your experience, understand platform usage, and enhance site navigation and security. You can control cookie settings through your browser.
Data Sharing and Disclosure 
We only share your data with third parties when necessary for service provision, legal compliance, or with your explicit consent. Our third-party service providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and do not have permission to use your personal data for their own purposes.
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy 
Mosaic, as a decentralized platform, is committed to maintaining high standards of compliance with anti-money laundering regulations where feasible. Recognizing the limitations inherent in a decentralized system, we focus on indirect measures to mitigate money laundering risks. 
AML Measures
Transaction Monitoring: We deploy algorithmic tools to analyze transaction patterns across the network that may suggest suspicious activity.
Smart Contract Audits: All smart contracts are rigorously audited by third- party security firms to prevent vulnerabilities that could facilitate illegal activities.
User Education: We provide guidance to our users on the importance of using Mosaic for legitimate transactions and the legal repercussions of illicit activities.
Community Reporting: Users are encouraged to report suspicious activities. While Mosaic  cannot freeze transactions or access user wallets, we take such reports seriously and investigate them to the best of our ability. 
Limitations Acknowledgment 
Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, our ability to directly enforce AML protocols is limited. However, we are dedicated to upholding the principles of AML compliance by discouraging and mitigating risks through the measures listed above.
Data Security 
Privacy and policy 2 We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no system can be entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
Your Rights 
You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Please contact us if you wish to make such a request.
Changes to This Policy 
We may update this policy periodically. We will notify you of significant changes and encourage you to review the policy regularly.
