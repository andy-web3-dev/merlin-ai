What is Echelon?
Echelon is a decentralized financial market written in the 
Move programming language
. Its users can borrow and lend assets to each other indirectly via non-custodial pools to earn interest or increase one's buying power with leverage.

V1 is a money market enabling permissionless borrowing and lending of assets. The protocol protects lenders from defaults and collateral volatility by requiring borrowers to over-collateralize loans, performing liquidations, and other other 
risk management parameters
.

Last updated

1. 
Pairs and Lending Mechanics
In each isolated market, users can borrow one type of token (Asset Token) by depositing another (Collateral Token).
Depositing Asset Tokens in a pair gives lenders a claim that is redeemable for an increasing quantity of Asset Tokens as interest accrues.
Borrowers deposit Collateral Tokens to gain the right to borrow Asset Tokens.
2. Interest Rate Mechanics
Interest is accrued continuously according to the formula: Pe^rt-e 
Interest rates are determined by a specific Rate Calculator contract for each pair. The Time-Weighted Variable Rate adjusts based on asset utilization - Rates decrease if utilization is low and increase if high.
Read our 
 section for more information.
3. Loan-To-Value (LTV)
LTV represents the ratio of borrowed assets to deposited collateral. It changes with market rates and interest accrual.
Borrowers must maintain their LTV below a pre-set Maximum LTV to avoid their position being marked unhealthy. To correct an unhealthy LTV, borrowers can add collateral or repay part of the loan.
The Maximum LTV is set for each individual asset pair. LTV information for the pairs supported at launch can be found under 
.
4. Liquidations
If a borrower’s LTV exceeds the Maximum LTV, any user can liquidate the position by repaying some or all of the debt, receiving collateral plus a fixed liquidation fee in return. The liquidation fee, set at deployment, is usually 10%.
5. Vault Account Mechanics
The Vault Account is a key element in the pair's accounting system, comprising two main components: the Account Value (total tokens within the vault) and a unique representation of ownership for each lender.
The Account Value reflects the overall holdings in the vault, including both the initial deposits and any accrued interest.
Lenders receive an increased value, symbolizing their contribution to the Vault Account. This can be redeemed in proportion to their share of the total Account Value at a later date.
As interest accrues within the pair, the Account Value increases, enhancing the redeemable value of each lender's token.

Borrowing Assets
Users can borrow asset tokens from a pair by supplying the necessary amount of collateral tokens. Interest on the borrowed amount accrues over the duration of the loan, incrementally increasing the total amount owed. To reclaim their collateral, borrowers must settle the loan in full, repaying the original loan amount plus the accrued interest. 
Unlike other protocols which issue deposit receipt tokens (eg. Compound’s c-tokens), Echelon manages deposit receipts within the smart contract which reduces complexity and vulnerability. 
Borrow APR indicates how much yearly interest you will have to pay on your debt.

Supplying Assets
Lenders contribute asset tokens to the lending pool and receive a claim to a corresponding portion of the pool's assets. Accounting for a user’s lending and borrowing balances is handled within the smart contract. 
At any time, lenders can redeem their claim for the original asset tokens, with the amount determined by the current market rate. The value of a lender's claim increases as interest accumulates in the pool, mirroring the growth in the pool's total assets. This system ensures that lenders see a balance that reflects the accruing interest.

The interest rate model is designed to mitigate liquidity risk, particularly when utilization is high. The model has two parts:
Below the optimal utilization rate (U_optimal), the rate increases gradually.
Beyond U_optimal, the rate increases steeply to discourage high utilization.
The interest rate 𝑅𝑡​ follows the model:
The borrow rates rise gently with increased utilization but spikes when utilization approaches full capacity, to manage the liquidity effectively. Interest rate (IR) curves dictate supply and borrow rates based on an asset’s utilization rate. These rates are intended to maintain market equilibrium, while ensuring that lenders can access their liquidity should they wish to withdraw capital.
Model Parameters:
Key parameters for the variable interest rate model include:
Optimal Utilization Rate (U_optimal)
Base Variable Borrow Rate
Variable Rate Slope 1 (before U_optimal)
Variable Rate Slope 2 (after U_optimal)
Theoretically, if the optimal Utilization rate was set to 100%, the rates would follow a linear model. 
It's essential to differentiate between assets primarily used as collateral, which require high liquidity for liquidation purposes, and those with ample liquidity on Echelon Markets, which contribute to a stable utilization rate. Market conditions also influence borrowing costs; Echelon's rates must remain competitive to prevent arbitrage opportunities.
In scenarios like liquidity mining, where borrow costs are influenced by external incentives, Echelon adapts its interest rates to balance the cost of borrowing with liquidity rewards. For the latest on deposit APY and borrowing costs, users should refer to the Echelon App interface for each asset.

Supply Rates
Details on how Supply Rates are determined
In Echelon Markets, when users borrow assets, the interest they pay is allocated as a yield to those who supplied those assets, creating the supply rate. A portion is set aside for the ecosystem reserve, as dictated by the reserve factor. This mechanism ensures that the yield generated from borrowed assets is equitably shared among all suppliers, contributing to the liquidity of the protocol.
The supply Annual Percentage Yield (APY) depends on several factors:
Utilization ratio: The proportion of lent out assets to the total available supply. 
Variable rate: The interest rate applied to loans with rates that can fluctuate based on market conditions. 
Reserve factor: The percentage of yield redirected to the protocol's liquidity reserve.
Supply rates may also be subsidized by other token incentives on a pool by pool basis. The most up to date information about the supply APY for each asset may be viewed on the Core Markets interface.

Echelon’s loan origination and liquidation services rely on price feeds from external data sources, also called Oracles. To ensure proper liquidations and avoid any bad debt, Echelon relies on three major oracle sources:
Pyth
Switchboard
Custom
Echelon primarily uses 
Pyth
 oracle price feeds. For assets not supported by Pyth, the protocol uses 
Switchboard
 oracles to gather price data. In the event that these providers go down, Echelon will switch to a temporary fallback by performing a cron job that fetches prices from DEXs and CEXs to maintain system integrity.

One can view the oracle providers for each market in the prices tab.
Custom Oracles for LSTs:
Echelon allows for looping of LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), enabling a higher LTV of 90% in eMode. To minimize risks, the price of LSTs is uniquely calculated through a combination of Pyth prices and on-chain staking rewards calculation. For instance, the price of sthAPT for liquidation is calculated as follows:
sthAPT = APT price [From Pyth] * thAPT/APT exchange rate [from Thala staking rate calculation]
The APT price comes from one of the safest and most advanced oracles, Pyth.
sthAPT is calculated on chain as thAPT + staking rewards.
Using the exchange rate between liquid Staked Aptos helps smooth the price during periods of low liquidity, by reflecting the true value of the position in APT after the unstaking period is complete.  Overall, this can significantly reduce the risks of liquidation from LST depegs, while also mitigating any risks of protocol bad debt associated with large liquidations.

Isolated Markets
Echelon also offers Isolated Markets with Assets that are separated from the global collateral pool. 
For example, in the global collateral pool (subject to LTV and supply caps), all assets can be borrowed and lent against - whereas in isolated pools only specific tokens are available and borrowing and lending are constrained by the availability of those tokens in the 'pool.' 
Isolated Markets allow for:
Listings of longer tail assets without significant protocol risk
Ability to support more aggressive parameters in isolation
Configurable debt cieling for isolated assets
Currently both Pyth and Switchboard Oracles are supported for these markets.

The Swap and Trade pages serve as an interface to other decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the ecosystem, allowing users to trade asset for another. 
Echelon Swap currently leverages two external exhange integrations to facilitate swaps.
Thalaswap
: This Automated Market Maker (AMM) incentivizes users to provide liquidity by offering them a share of the fees accumulated in the pool. This facilitates efficient and quick exchanges. Users set a desired slippage tolerance and select assets to swap between.

Econia
: A high-performance on-chain order book built on Aptos. This allows for more precise and customizable swapping options, complementing the liquidity provided by Thalaswap.

Echelon Chain
Last updated

Echelons smart contracts are currently running on Aptos. To interact with the protocol, users must bridge over assets over from other chains. The bridge page assists users in this via integrations with two of the largest cross chain bridging providers. 
Layerzero Bridge
The LayerZero bridge is the recommended for bridging between Aptos and other chains such as Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Optimism. This bridge requires you to have destination gas in order for the transaction to go through.
Wormhole Bridge
The Wormhole bridge is recommended for bridging between Aptos and Sui. This bridge requires the payment of gas fees to process transactions.

Smart Contract Risk
While Echeolon has been audited, vulnerabilities may be missed by its developers and core contributors in its smart contracts (developed in the Aptos-Move language) that facilitate user to platform interaction. Echelon's smart contracts  are undergoing an audit with Ottersec. Please note, there is a possibility of a missed attack vector or bug which may be critical to the health of the protocol. 
In realizing this, bug bounties are available to the community, however it is possible that such risks exist in the protocol arising from smart contract errors such as:
Theft of protocol funds
Theft of user funds 
Theft of unrealized yield 
Attacks on protocol parameters through governance 
Bounties will be determined by the degree of the reported vulnerability with reported critical vulnerabilities being rewarded with the highest bounties.

Oracle Risk
As Echelon's products rely heavily on price feeds from partnered oracles, inaccuracies in price feeds may result in unexpected liquidations for borrowers or lenders.  As such, Echelon attempts to follow an 
Asset Listing
 process and continued monitoring of available collateral assets and their oracle price feeds. In the event of an oracle exploit determined by pre-established conditions, Echelon will switch to a backup oracle as explained here. 
Note that given the variety of oracles used and assets listed, it's up to users depositing in each market to note which oracle is being used and properly assess their own risk tolerance. For example, some oracles depend on pool prices which are subject to quick change in volatile market conditions, while others are custom based on asset exchange rates, and others rely on third parties like Pyth and Switchboard.

Bad Debt Risk
The primary risk for both the protocol and lenders is that the value of the borrowers’ collateral decreases to below the debt value or the debt increases too rapidly. In either scenario, the borrower lacks a financial incentive to repay their loan, as it would result in a loss, leading to bad debt.

While Echelon/s liquidation framework aims to effectively repay vault loans in an effective manner, issues may arise during the liquidation process (high market volatility, slippage, gas costs, illiquidity, etc.) which may prevent the deposited collateral from being sold in a timely manner to make up for the borrowed amount, resulting in the protocol accruing bad debt. 

So bad debt may be realized in "black swan" events. And possibly, an inability to repay user loans may arise due to insufficient liquidity caused by adverse market conditions. Accrued bad debt will be socialized among all lenders to the pool.

Risk Management
Echelon Markets was designed in accordance with a commitment to protocol stability and follows best practices adopted by other lending markets. In this section, an overview of the specific protocol features designed to mitigate risk is outlined.  
Risk Parameters 
Each asset in the Echelon protocol has specific risk values that affect how they're used for lending and borrowing. V1 includes parameters focusing on security, governance, and managing market dynamics.
Understanding the risks associated with each asset is crucial, including smart contract security, centralization risks, and market dynamics. Assets bring their inherent risks into the Echelon Markets ecosystem. V1 introduces risk parameters that facilitate the onboarding of high-risk assets with defined limits.
Assets in Echelon Markets are added through governance proposals or by Asset Listing Admins appointed by governance.
Risk parameters in Echelon Markets mitigate market risks. In V1, each loan requires over-collateralization with assets subject to market volatility. Adequate margins and incentives are vital to maintain collateralization during adverse market conditions. If collateral value falls below a set threshold, a portion is liquidated to repay debt and maintain collateralization.
Liquidation Threshold
Echelon determines the risk of a loan through the Liquidation Threshold, which is calculated by the weighted average of each collateral type against the total collateral. 
Liquidation Threshold: 
When the loan's value relative to the collateral exceeds this threshold, the loan is at risk of being liquidated to protect lenders and the protocol.


Liquidation Penalty and Factor
A Liquidation Penalty is incurred on the collateral's value during liquidation, serving as a fee for the liquidation process. The Liquidation Factor decides how much of this penalty is directed to the ecosystem's treasury, ensuring a balance between user protection and protocol sustainability. 

Health Factor
The Health Factor is a critical gauge of an account's risk, reflecting the proportion of collateral to borrowed assets. It accounts for market fluctuations and collateral performance. 
The health factor is calculated as: 
A Health Factor below 1 indicates that the account is under-collateralized, prompting potential liquidation to preserve the protocol's solvency.


Reserve Factor
Allocates a portion of protocol interest to the ecosystem treasury, calibrated based on asset risk.
Collateral Usage
Certain assets, like USDT and sUSD, are limited to Isolation Mode due to high centralization risks. In contrast, certain assets may, despite being decentralized, not be used as collateral due to limited testing and liquidity. Up to date information for a specific pool’s allowed criteria can be found on the Borrow page of the Echelon App.
Market risks directly influence risk parameters, with liquidity and volatility playing key roles. The most volatile assets have lower LTV and higher liquidation thresholds, while more stable assets like stablecoins, APT, and Liquid Staked APT have higher LTV limits.
Max LTV, liquidation threshold, liquidation bonuses and reserve factors are set per market.

Echelon Markets designs these parameters to be dynamic, reflecting real-time market conditions and maintaining a stable lending environment.

Asset-level Risk Parameters
Each asset in the Echelon Markets protocol has specific risk values that affect how they're used for lending and borrowing. V1 enhances risk mitigation with additional parameters focusing on security, governance, and market dynamics.
Understanding the risks associated with each asset is crucial, including smart contract security, centralization risks, and market dynamics. Assets bring their inherent risks into the Echelon Markets ecosystem. V1 introduces advanced risk parameters, facilitating the onboarding of high-risk assets with defined limits.
The main collateral market and isolsted markets have different requirements and functions. When assets being considered for listing, their usage, distribution, liquidity, and overall quality are assess to determine LTVs, supply + borrow caps, and interest rate models. 
Assets in Echelon Markets are added through governance proposals or by Asset Listing Admins appointed by governance. 
Risk parameters in Echelon Markets mitigate market risks. In V1, each loan requires over-collateralization with assets subject to market volatility. Adequate margins and incentives are vital to maintain collateralization during adverse market conditions. If collateral value falls below a set threshold, a portion is liquidated to repay debt and maintain collateralization.
These parameters, including collateralization and liquidation rules, are asset-specific.
V1 introduces tried and true risk parameters from various lending markets.
Supply Caps
: Limit the maximum supply of an asset to the protocol, based on on-chain liquidity and total collateral volume.
Borrow Caps
: Set a maximum borrow limit for an asset to prevent price exploits, large liquidations and insolvency risks. 
Maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV): 
The maximum borrowing power of a given collateral asset.
Liquidation Thresholds (LT): 
The point at where collateral can be liquidated to repay lenders.
Liquidation Incentives: 
Portion of repaid collateral that is given to liquidators.
Efficiency Mode (eMode)
: Special configuration for correlated assets. Higher LTV ratios for capital efficiency, lower Liquidation Incentives to decrease chance of bad debt on leveraged positions.

Liquidations
A critical process in protecting pool lenders, which is triggered when a borrower's health factor falls below 100% due to their collateral value not adequately covering their loan or debt value.
This might happen when the collateral decreases in value, or the borrowed debt increases in value relative to each other. This collateral-to-loan value ratio is reflected in the health factor, based on the account's margin determined by the liquidation threshold (LT) of each collateral asset.
Liquidations are triggered by Oracle price feeds and managed by liquidator bots ran internally and by third parties. A liquidation penalty is applied to the value of the collateral during liquidation, serving as an incentive to execute the liquidation. A portion of the seized collateral goes to liquidator incentives.
If during a liquidation the quoted value of borrowers collateral is unable to fully be recovered, bad debt may accrue. This may be due to insufficient liquidity. Accrued bad debt will be socialized among all lenders to the pool.
Liquidations are open source and permissionless. Visit

Asset Listing
Echelon core protocol facilitates the supply and borrowing of digital assets through liquidity pools. When users supply assets, they receive protocol-issued tokens that represent both the supplied assets and the accumulated yield. Collateral secures each loan, serving as a safeguard against default. While Echelon is not directly responsible for the activity/liquidity of any specific pool, many considerations must  be addressed by it's core contributors before creating new markets
For V1, the following considerations apply to listed assets:
Each new token adds a permanent, slight increase to transaction gas costs due to the added complexity in the smart contracts.
Introducing a new token as collateral elevates the protocol's insolvency risk. Tokens used as collateral are effectively the protocol's assets, and borrowed tokens represent its liabilities. Since borrows are primarily stablecoins and collateral is often in volatile assets, the following principles are key:
Only assets with strong risk profiles should be supported as collateral in the main market.
Assets with lower liquidity or risk profiles may be supported in isolated lending only. 


V1's is designed to mitigate the insolvency risk when listing new, riskier tokens.
Centralized assets as collateral introduce a centralization risk due to single points of failure that affect the Echelon protocol.
Assets with potential oracle manipulation risks are restricted to single-asset borrowing to prevent multi-asset exposure.
Long tail collateral assets are limited to isolated pool listings to minimize risk to main pool lenders.

Tokens that are enabled solely for supply and borrowing, not collateralization, present a lower risk. These tokens must always be significantly overcollateralized to ensure protocol solvency. For example, a user may supply MOD as collateral and borrow MOD backed by this collateral; however, assets not permitted as collateral must always be borrowed against less risky assets.
Diverse liquidity sources mitigate risk through diversification.
When onboarding a new token, it's crucial that the Echelon community conducts thorough analysis to ensure the asset introduces more value than risk. Only tokens with a substantial backing and a significant community presence should be considered. Our asset risk methodology provides a framework to evaluate tokens' risks to the protocol and calibrate parameters accordingly to manage those risks.

Management of New Market Listings
The introduction of new tokens into the Echelon ecosystem will initially be overseen by the Echelon core team. In the future, this responsibility will transition to the Asset Listing Governance Team, which will operate under the guidance and decisions of Echelon token holders. Further details on this process will be shared in due course.

Multisig
Every code upgrade and treasury transaction must be approved by 3/4 multisig. This is enforced through a multisignature contract which only allows code upgrades when 3 out of 4 signers have signed the upgrade with their cold storage wallet. 

2FA
All accounts managed by contributors are secured by two factor authentication using an authenticator app, reducing the likelihood of access being granted to a malicious actor via methods such as 
sim-swapping
. 
Audits
Our auditors have also checked for centralization risks when auditing . This means that potential backdoors, deliberate exploit opportunities and other risks are reported by the auditor with or without the contributor's approval.
For more information on audits and to find the full list of audits performed on the Echelon codebase see the next page.

This documentation by Echelon Labs and/or its affiliates (“we”, “us” and “our”) is for information purposes only. We do not provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice, and nothing in this article should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, sell or issue or subscribe for, or a recommendation for any security, investment, cryptocurrency, token or other services, product or commodity by us or any third party. You alone are solely responsible for determining whether any purchase, sale, investment, security or strategy, or any other product or service, is appropriate or suitable for you based on your personal objectives and personal and financial situation and for evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of the information in this article before making any decisions based on such information or other content. You should consult a lawyer and/or tax professional regarding your specific legal and/or tax situation. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Therefore, you should not assume that the future performance of any specific investment, cryptocurrency, token, commodity or strategy will be profitable or equal to corresponding past performance levels. Inherent in any such transaction is the potential for loss. No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any transaction is suitable for a particular person. By accessing this article, you acknowledge and agree to all of the foregoing and that you bear responsibility for your own research, due diligence and transaction decisions. You also agree that we, our affiliates and our respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, shareholders, members, representatives, advisors and agents will not be liable for any decision made or action taken by you and others based on this article, news, information, opinion, or any other material published, discussed or disseminated by us.
This article contains forward-looking statements or forward-looking information (referred to collectively as “forward-looking statements”). Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “goal”, “seek”, “believe”, “predict”, “project”, “estimate”, “expect”, “strategy”, “future”, “likely”, “may”, “should”, ”would”, “will”, and similar terms and phrases and the negatives of such expressions, including references to assumptions. Examples of forward-looking statements in this article include, among others, statements we make regarding our future plans, expectations and objectives.
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: reliance on blockchain technology and blockchain technology service providers; digital asset transactions being irrevocable and losses occurring from such transactions; our use and reliance on proprietary data and intellectual property in its business; potential misuses of digital assets and malicious actors in the digital asset industry; digital assets potentially being subject to hold periods; developments and changes in laws and regulations; and disruptions to our technology network including computer systems, software and cloud data, or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures or equipment. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive.
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this article is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by applicable securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Running a Liquidator Bot
Guide on setting up a liquidator bot to participate in the open-source liquidation process
Background & Reference
Echelons liquidation accounting is inspired by Compound V2, so most Compound V2 concepts apply.
How Liquidations work on Echelon
A vault is composed of collaterals and liabilities.
A vault becomes liquidatable when:
- 100% > health factor = account margin / liability value.
- account margin = sum(collateral value * Liquidation Threshold).
- let's say the vault has $10,000 worth of APT and $20,000 worth of USDC. APT liquidation threshold = 74% while USDC liquidation threshold = 82%. The account's margin = 10k * 74% + 20k * 82% = $23,800.
- All asset price are quoted from 
Oracles

Liquidators are encouraged to call 
liquidate
 to repay part of the liability and seize collateral at discount (
close_factor
 determines the max one can repay, and 
liquidation_incentives
 determines the discount). 
Given a vault could have M collateral assets and N liability assets, it is up to liquidators to decide what asset to repay and what asset to seize (M*N combinations). Hence the interface:
Copy
public fun liquidate<CoinType>


    liquidator: &signer,


    borrower_addr: address,


    borrow_market_obj: Object<Market>,


    collateral_market_obj: Object<Market>,


    repay_asset: Coin<CoinType>,


    min_shares_out: u64) { ... }

Note that 
min_shares_out
 is a liquidator-friendly check that guarantees the minimal shares to seize, which otherwise aborts the liqudation transaction.
Parameters and Data
Protocol parameters
- close factor: 50%
- liquidation incentives: 107%
